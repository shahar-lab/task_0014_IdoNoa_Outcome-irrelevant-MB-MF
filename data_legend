# This readme file described all variables that are saved in the project
subject_num - in file name *why not in the file as a column?*
phase - training/experiment *use "block_type" which is more common*
trial - trial number
left_person - a number between 1 and 4 describing the person offered on the left side of the screen - referring to the numbers from "humansLst"
left_person_objects - the objects offered by the left_person, fruit(1/2) and clothing (1/2) - according to the variable "model"
*why not two vars left_person_fruit left_person_cloth?*
right_person - a number between 1 and 4 describing the person offered on the right side of the screen 
right_person_objects - the objects offered by the right_person, fruit(1/2) and clothing (1/2) - according to the variable "model"
*same as above*
keypress1 - the key used to select the person choice - could be "s" or "k" and is used to infer location
*I think keypress_person and then rt_person is better to be consistent with ch_person*
rt1 - response time of person choice
ch_person - the person number indicating the chosen person
ch_objects - the objects offered by the chosen person 
* as above - I would go with two seperate vars*
unch_person - the person number indicating the unchosen person
unch_objects - the objects offered by the unchosen person
*same as above*
exp_value_fruit - reward expected value for the fruit 
reward_fruit - fruit montery outcome (0/1 for unrewarded vs. rewarded)
exp_value_wear - reward expected value for the chosen clothing
reward_wear - cloth montery outcome (0/1 for unrewarded vs. rewarded)
*I think it would be good if you can add location_fruit and location_wear*
keypress2 - the key/location used to uncover the second product (could be either fruit or wear, depending which was presented first)
rt2 - response time to uncover the second product
keypress3 - the key/location used to select the third product (could be either fruit or wear, depending which was presented first)
rt3 - response time to make the third choice
fruit_wear_first - an indicator of which object outcome was presented first
iti - inter-trial-interval
