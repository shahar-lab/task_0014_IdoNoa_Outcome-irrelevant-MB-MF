# This readme file described all variables that are saved in the project
subject_num - in file name
*can we add a subject column inside the data frame?*
phase - training/experiment *better use "block_type" which is more common*
*you are missing a block cloumn here...*
trial - trial number
left_person - a number between 1 and 4 describing the person offered on the left side of the screen - referring to the numbers from "humansLst"
left_person_objects - the objects offered by the left_person, fruit(1/2) and clothing (1/2) - according to the variable "model"
*I think we should use two var left_person_fruit left_person_wear*
right_person - a number between 1 and 4 describing the person offered on the right side of the screen 
right_person_objects - the objects offered by the right_person, fruit(1/2) and clothing (1/2) - according to the variable "model"
*same as above - two vars*
keypress1 - the key used to select the person choice - could be "s" or "k" and is used to infer location
rt1 - response time of person choice
ch_person - the person number indicating the chosen person
ch_objects - the objects offered by the chosen person
*two vars I think would be better* 
unch_person - the person number indicating the unchosen person
unch_objects - the objects offered by the unchosen person
exp_value_fruit - the expected value for the selected fruit
reward_fruit - fruit montery outcome
exp_value_wear - the expected value to selected cloth
reward_wear - the reward outcome for the clothing
*I think we should also have wear_location and fruit_location*
keypress2 - the key used to select the second choice (could be either fruit or wear, depending which was presented first)
rt2 - response time to make the second choice
*if its not to hard - can we also have a product2 and product3 column?*
keypress3 - the key used to select the third choice (could be either fruit or wear, depending which was presented first)
rt3 - response time to make the third choice
fruit_wear_first - an indicator of which object outcome was presented first
iti - inter-trial-interval
* I would also add fruit1_exp_value, fruit2_expvalue, wear1_expvalue, wear2_expvalue - these can really help sometimes...*
